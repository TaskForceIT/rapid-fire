The Rapid Fire job contains files, which have fields with the SQL GENERATED clause. If you continue, then the values of the
fields with the SQL GENERATED clause will be regenerated for each record in the file. Don`t use Rapid Fire for files with the
SQL GENERATED clause for a field if this causes problems in your application.

If this Rapid Fire job has been created by the Change Management System CMOne and ALL the fields listed below are handled by
a separate SQL script with the typcode IDYCOL, then you can ignore this message.
